    <h1>Presentaion</h1>
	<p>I’m a 27-year-old woman studying Multimedia Design at KEA, currently in my 3rd semester. My background and interests have always revolved around fashion, customer service, and sustainability. I initially joined KEA to improve my skills in Adobe and content creation, with the goal of combining creativity and modern design.

		However, during my studies, I discovered a passion for coding and web development. I became fascinated with building visually appealing and functional websites, which led me to choose front-end development as my elective. I am now focused on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly web experiences.
		
		I am eager to deepen my knowledge of both front-end and backend development, exploring different programming languages and the full software development process. My goal is to merge my creative background with technical skills to deliver solutions that are not only visually engaging but also sustainable and efficient.</p>
